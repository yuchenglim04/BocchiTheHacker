# BocchiTheRock

This is supposedly an NTU math and physics club. But since Physics is the theory of everything, everything technical and crazy fits here too.

Also, this club is unofficial, so no CCA points granted. We hope members are here for the Science, not CCA points.

Goals of this club:  
- encourage students to take on the challenge to self-learn
- provide guidance on where to start, and ideas on how crazy things can be
- tips and tricks :)
